        The Index
      </p>
      <p class="main-1"> 
        The Human Development Index (commonly referred to as <b>HDI</b>) is a measure used globably to rank countries.<br>
        Three important factors are considered for when taking measures for the index:
      <ul class="list">
        <li>healthcare - measured by life expectancy</li>
        <li>education - measured by the mean and expected years of schooling</li>
        <li>income - measured by the gross national income per person.</li>
      </ul> 
      <p class="main-1">
        As it is an index, HDI scores will fall between 0.00 and 1.00. <br>
        The greater the value of each measure,the higher the HDI score will be.<br>
        HDI scores are spilt into four statuses: 
        <span class="vh">very high</span>, <span class="h">high</span>, <span class="m">medium</span> and <span class="l">low.</span>.

        Income vs Health
      </p>
      <p class="main-2"> 
        Could one component of <b>HDI</b> explain another component?
        It is a basic human desire to be healthy. Being healthy allows people to live their lives.
        How can people ensure that they remain healthy?<br>
        <br>
        Money is power. That applies in many aspects in life. Having money provides people with the means to "buy" a longer life. 
        And that is clearly demonstrated here.<br>
        <br>
        People in <span class="l">low</span> status countries have very little income, therefore unable to "buy" long lives.
        As income increaes, life expectancy also rises. The trend is an inverse-exponential, dropping off around the 
        $40,000 mark, after moving into the territory of countries with <span class="vh">very high</span> status.<br>
        <br>
        Even money has it's limits. Although, this is not to imply that money is the only factor to a long life.

        School Days

      <p class="main-2"> 
        Education is important. It is a constant reminder in this world. Without it, life will be difficult. 
        The <b>HDI</b> definitely agrees.<br>
        <br>
        Comparing this plot to the map. It is clear that HDI considers education as a strong indicator
        for human development. In Europe, there are no countries with a status lower than <span class="h">high</span>. 
        Over in Africa, the majority comprises of <span class="l">low</span> status countries.<br>
        <br>
        The plot here tells all. Europe is the only region where the <span class="mn">mean</span> years of schooling is above 10 years.
        On the other hand, Africa by far has the poorest education standards, sitting below 6 years.<br>
        <br>
        It would be unfair to insinate that African nations have impeded themselves. 
        The region, on average, <span class="e">expects</span> close to 11 years of schooling. 
        There could be plenty of underlying factors which contribute to the shortcomings of education in the region.

        Relative Ranking
      </p>
      <p class="main-2">
        Paired with the plot above, a comparison, among all regions, 
        of the measures involved in calculating the <b>HDI</b> can be done.<br>
        <br>
        Europe ranks 1st in all categories by a hefty gap, with life expectancy being the sole exception.
        For this measure, most regions, bar Africa, have values floating around the 75 years mark.
        But for all other indicators, Europe has little competition.<br>
        <br>
        While Africa consistently ranks last in all categories, 2nd place is a close race between Asia and South America.
        For most indicators, only a small gap separates the two regions. However, Asia overwhelmingly defeats South America 
        on gross national income per person by around $5000.

        Some countries saw their position rise significantly between the year 2021, and the preceding year, 2020. <br>
        Although, several others ended up falling instead. <br>
        <br>
        Keep in mind, these changes may not be self-inflicted. It could be the result of other countries' <b>HDI</b> scores changing.
        So a country may not have made a step backwards in, or greatly improved on, human development.<br>
